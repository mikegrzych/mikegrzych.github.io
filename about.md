I'm a recent graduate from the University of Michigan, having earned my BSE in Computer Science. I'm a born Michigan native, and my goal is to stay here and help support local Michigan businesses and startups.

You can find me on Twitter at [@grizzytron](https://twitter.com/grizzytron), and you can view by public projects on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/mikegrzych).

I am currently looking for work in or near the Ann Arbor and Detroit Metro areas! You can view my resume [here](/files/Resume.pdf).
